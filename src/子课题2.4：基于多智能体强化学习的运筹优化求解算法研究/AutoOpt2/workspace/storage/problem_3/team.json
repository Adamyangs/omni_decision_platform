By setting `C = int(C_min)` directly, it only tests the *smallest integer C meeting the lower bounds*, but does not check whether a slightly larger integer C could yield a lower overall cost if it allows a smaller B (when iterating over B values). Since the objective coefficients are positive, increasing C always increases cost for a fixed B, so for each B the minimal feasible C is indeed optimal. However, the enumeration assumes B is constrained to 0–10, but it doesn’t verify that higher B values beyond 10 are infeasible due to the constraint `B ≤ 10`. The code’s current enumeration range is correct for this specific problem, but if the upper bound on B were not provided explicitly, the approach would need adjustment. The main risk is that if the objective coefficient for C were negative (which it isn’t here), the current enumeration would fail to find the optimum.",
