However, this approach has a **critical flaw**: the search range `int(x_opt) - 2, int(x_opt) + 3` (and similarly for `y`) is too narrow and may miss the true optimal integer solution, especially when the continuous optimum is not close to any feasible integer point.  \n\nIn this specific case, the continuous LP relaxation yields an optimal solution that is not near the actual integer optimum, causing the search to potentially fail. The execution found `(x, y) = (0, 2)` with `Z = 14`, but a manual check suggests better integer solutions may exist within the feasible region. For example, `(x, y) = (1, 0)` yields `Z = 6`, which is lower, but other points like `(0, 3)` are infeasible due to constraints. Yet, without a broader or systematic search (e.g., checking all integer combinations within the feasible bounds derived from constraints), the method is unreliable.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nIf integer programming is required, use a proper integer programming solver (e.g., `scipy.optimize.milp` introduced in SciPy 1.9+, or dedicated libraries like `pulp`, `ortools`). Alternatively, implement an exhaustive search over the feasible integer space, which for small problems can be derived from constraint bounds (e.g., `x ≤ 1`, `y ≤ 3` from `30x + 20y ≤ 80` and `x, y ≥ 0`).",
