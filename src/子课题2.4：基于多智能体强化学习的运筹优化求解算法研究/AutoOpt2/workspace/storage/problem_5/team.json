Mixing these operations can lead to mistakes if constraints are added or rearranged later.  \n\n**Improved approach**: Define `A_ub` and `b_ub` in one clear block:  \n```python\nA_ub = np.array([\n    [0.5, 0.2],    # 0.5x1 + 0.2x2 <= 5\n    [-0.4, -0.5]   # -0.4x1 - 0.5x2 <= -4  (converted from 0.4x1 + 0.5x2 >= 4)\n])\nb_ub = np.array([5, -4])\n```\nThis enhances readability and reduces the risk of misalignment between rows of `A_ub` and `b_ub`.",
