The current implementation uses `[-2, 1]` in `A` with `b = 0`, which effectively represents `-2x + y ≤ 0`. This flips the inequality direction, violating the intended `y ≥ 2x` constraint.\n\nThis error likely leads to the solution `(x=100, y=0)`, which does not satisfy `y ≥ 2x`, since `0` is not greater than or equal to `200`.",
