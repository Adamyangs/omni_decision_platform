The code would benefit from explicitly verifying the original constraints (including the `>=` one) after solving, rather than relying solely on `result.success`.  \n\nA critical comment:  \n**The code should verify the solution against the original inequality constraints to ensure feasibility, especially since one constraint was manually converted to the solver's standard form.**",
