The maximum profit is calculated as $80,000, but if we check with the constraints:  \n- **Constraint 1:** \\( x + y \\leq 200 \\) — this is satisfied since \\( 100 + 100 = 200 \\).  \n- **Constraint 2:** \\( 2000x + 1000y \\leq 300,000 \\) — this gives \\( 2000(100) + 1000(100) = 300,000 \\), so also satisfied.  \n\nHowever, if we calculate the profit manually:  \n\\[\n500 \\times 100 + 300 \\times 100 = 50,000 + 30,000 = 80,000\n\\]\nThat matches.  \n\nBut why is this critical? Because the second constraint is exactly tight (no slack), and both constraints are active simultaneously, meaning the solution lies exactly at the intersection of the two constraint lines. In practice, such precise alignment might be coincidental or could indicate a sensitivity issue—any small change in coefficients (e.g., profit per unit or cost limits) could shift the optimal solution significantly. You should test the solution’s stability by perturbing the constraints slightly to ensure the model is robust.",
