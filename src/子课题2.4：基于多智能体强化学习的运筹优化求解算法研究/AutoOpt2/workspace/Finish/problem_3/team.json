For integer linear programming, constraints should be satisfied exactly where possible (or within a very small tolerance, but 0.01 may be too large relative to the constraint's scale). A more robust approach would be to directly check `≤ 0` for integer values, as floating-point errors are less likely with integers, or use a smaller tolerance like `1e-9`. Additionally, the fallback to floor values when no feasible neighbor is found is not guaranteed to yield a feasible or optimal integer solution; a systematic search around the continuous optimum would be better.",

A more robust approach would be to directly check `≤ 0` for integer values, as floating-point errors are less likely with integers, or use a smaller tolerance like `1e-9`.
