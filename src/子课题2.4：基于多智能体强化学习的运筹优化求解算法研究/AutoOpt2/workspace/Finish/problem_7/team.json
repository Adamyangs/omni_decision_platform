The code solves the continuous LP problem, gets an optimal solution (likely with fractional values), rounds to integers, and then checks constraints. However, this approach doesn't guarantee that the rounded integer solution will be feasible or optimal for the integer problem. The constraint `F > L` becomes particularly sensitive after rounding.\n\nSpecifically, if the continuous solution has values where `F` is only slightly greater than `L` (e.g., `F = 15.2`, `L = 14.8`), rounding could reverse the inequality (`F=15`, `L=15`) and violate `F > L`. This is likely what happened, causing the constraint violation message.\n\nTo properly solve this as an integer linear programming problem, you should use an integer programming solver (like `scipy.optimize.milp` or a dedicated library like `pulp` or `ortools`) rather than solving the continuous relaxation and rounding.",
