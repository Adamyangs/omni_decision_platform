For a more rigorous approach, you should define these ranges based on constraint bounds. For instance, from \\( x \\geq 3y \\) and \\( 3x + 2y \\leq 200 \\), you can derive \\( 3(3y) + 2y \\leq 200 \\) → \\( 11y \\leq 200 \\) → \\( y \\leq 18.18 \\). Since y must be an integer ≥10, y can only be 10–18. Similarly, x is bounded by \\( x \\geq 3y \\) and \\( 3x \\leq 200 - 2y \\). Using these precise bounds would make the search smaller and ensure completeness without arbitrary limits.",
