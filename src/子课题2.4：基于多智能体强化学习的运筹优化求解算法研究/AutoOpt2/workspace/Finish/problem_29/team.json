For example, T=77 might work with C=116 or other combinations that satisfy 2T + 3C ≥ 500 with a smaller T.\n\n**Recommendation**: To properly solve an integer linear programming problem, use `method='highs'` with integrality constraints parameter, or implement a systematic search over the feasible integer space, not just neighboring points.",
