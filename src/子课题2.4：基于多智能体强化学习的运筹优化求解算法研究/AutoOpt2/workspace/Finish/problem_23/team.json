The original constraint is \\( 60x + 40y \\geq 1000 \\), which should be rewritten as \\( -60x - 40y \\leq -1000 \\). However, the code currently uses `b_ub = [-1000, 430]`, which corresponds to:\n\n1. \\(-60x - 40y \\leq -1000\\)  \n2. \\(30x + 15y \\leq 430\\)\n\nBut the second constraint should remain \\( 30x + 15y \\leq 430 \\), so the inequality matrix \\(A\\_ub\\) should correctly represent both constraints in \\(\\leq\\) form. Currently, \\(A\\_ub\\) has `[60, 40]` for the first row instead of `[-60, -40]`. This mismatch leads to an incorrect formulation, causing the solver to find no feasible solution.\n\n**Correction needed:**  \nUpdate `A_ub` to `[[-60, -40], [30, 15]]` so that both rows in \\(A\\_ub\\) align with the \\(\\leq\\) inequalities in \\(b\\_ub\\).",
